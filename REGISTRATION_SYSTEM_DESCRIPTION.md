The code for this repository will be a class registration system for students in high school and middle school.  So there needs to be data entities for students, teachers, classes, parents.  For the website, a parent should be able to login, add family information (including children/students, email address, phone number, other family members).  A teacher should be able to login and create classes, and view their classes, class schedules, and students.  A parent can have multiple family members, and a child/student can have multiple family members.  A parent can enroll their children/students in classes.  A student should be able to login and view their class schedule including the teacher, class time, class materials/syllabus, and class location.
